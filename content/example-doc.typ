= Introduction $e^(pi i)$
*Scientific writing* is a _crucial_ part of the research process, allowing researchers to share their findings with the wider scientific community. However, the process of typesetting scientific documents can often be a frustrating and time-consuming affair, particularly when using outdated tools such as LaTeX. Despite being over 30 years old, it remains a popular choice for scientific writing due to its power and flexibility. However, it also comes with a steep learning curve, complex syntax, and long compile times, leading to frustration and despair for many researchers. //@netwok2020

== Paper overview

In this paper we introduce Typst, a new typesetting system designed to streamline the scientific writing process and provide researchers with a fast, efficient, and easy-to-use alternative to existing systems. Our goal is to shake up the status quo and offer researchers a better way to approach scientific writing.

  Euler's identity is $e^(pi i) + 1 = 0$. Do you really believe that they charged an armed enemy, or treated their children, their own flesh and blood, so cruelly, without a thought for their own interest or advantage?
  $ i planck.reduce frac(diff, diff t) Psi lr((x comma t)) eq lr([minus frac(planck.reduce^2, 2 m) frac(diff^2, diff x^2) plus V lr((x comma t))]) Psi lr((x comma t)) $
]

By leveraging advanced algorithms and a user-friendly interface, Typst offers several advantages over existing typesetting systems, including faster document creation, simplified syntax, and increased ease-of-use to where `variable` and `print()` shall be of use.

```python
if a != b:
  print("Hello world!")
else if a == b:
  print("Goodbye world!")
else:
    print("Something else")
  
print("This is a long sentence where I ramble until I get 80 characters here.")
```

To demonstrate the potential of Typst, we conducted a series of experiments comparing it to other popular typesetting systems, including LaTeX. Our findings suggest that Typst offers several benefits for scientific writing, particularly for novice users who may struggle with the complexities of LaTeX. Additionally, we demonstrate that Typst offers advanced features for experienced users, allowing for greater customization and flexibility in document creation.

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of the pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.

Overall, we believe that Typst represents a significant step forward in the field of scientific writing and typesetting, providing researchers with a valuable tool to streamline their workflow and focus on what really matters: their research. In the following sections, we will introduce Typst in more detail and provide evidence for its superiority over other typesetting systems in a variety of scenarios.

#lorem(86) The mechanical energy equation is obtained by integrating the Euler equation along a streamline, and is given by:

$ P_1 + alpha_(1) (rho v_1^2)/(2) + rho g z_1 = P_2 + alpha_(2) (rho v_2^2)/(2) + rho g z_2 + w_s $

#lorem(50) The million dollar equation and the solution that will revolutionize the world of science and technology pertaining to fluids is the Navier-Stokes equation. It is a set of coupled differential equations that describe the motion of fluids. The Navier-Stokes equation is given by:

$ nabla dot u &= 0 \
- nabla p + mu nabla^2 u + bold(upright(F)) &= overbrace(dboxed(rho (d u)/(d t)), "stress") $
