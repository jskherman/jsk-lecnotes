Can you then _suppose_ that those heroic men performed their famous deeds *without any motive at all*? In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, _*every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided*_. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. @netwok2020

- But in certain emergencies and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.

This being the theory I hold, why need I be afraid of not being able to reconcile it with the case of my ancestors? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of the pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.

  Euler's identity is $e^(pi i) + 1 = 0$. Do you really believe that they charged an armed enemy, or treated their children, their own flesh and blood, so cruelly, without a thought for their own interest or advantage?
  $ i planck.reduce frac(diff, diff t) Psi lr((x comma t)) eq lr([minus frac(planck.reduce^2, 2 m) frac(diff^2, diff x^2) plus V lr((x comma t))]) Psi lr((x comma t)) $

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. Can you then suppose that those heroic men performed their famous deeds without any motive at all? Your references to them just now were historically correct, and also showed your kind and friendly feeling towards myself; but all the same I am not to be bribed by your flattery of my family, and you will not find me a less resolute opponent. Increase ease-of-use to where `variable` and `print()` shall be of use.

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?

Overall, we believe that Typst represents a significant step forward in the field of scientific writing and typesetting, providing researchers with a valuable tool to streamline their workflow and focus on what really matters: their research. In the following sections, we will introduce Typst in more detail and provide evidence for its superiority over other typesetting systems in a variety of scenarios.

= Methods
#lorem(86) The mechanical energy equation is obtained by integrating the Euler equation along a streamline, and is given by:

$ P_1 + alpha_(1) (rho v_1^2)/(2) + rho g z_1 = P_2 + alpha_(2) (rho v_2^2)/(2) + rho g z_2 + w_s $

#lorem(50) The million dollar equation and the solution that will revolutionize the world of science and technology pertaining to fluids is the Navier-Stokes equation. It is a set of coupled differential equations that describe the motion of fluids. The Navier-Stokes equation is given by:

$ nabla dot u &= 0 \
- nabla p + mu nabla^2 u + bold(upright(F)) &= overbrace(dboxed(rho (d u)/(d t)), "stress") $
