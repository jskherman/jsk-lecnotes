= Introduction
Can you then _suppose_ that those heroic men performed their famous deeds *without any motive at all*? In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, _*every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided*_ @netwok2020.

- But in certain emergencies and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.

- Your references to them just now were historically correct, and also showed your kind and friendly feeling towards myself; but all the same I am not to be bribed by your flattery of my family, and you will not find me a less resolute opponent.

== Paper overview

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of the pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.

  Euler's identity is $e^(pi i) + 1 = 0$. Do you really believe that they charged an armed enemy, or treated their children, their own flesh and blood, so cruelly, without a thought for their own interest or advantage? Such is Schr√∂dinger's equation in @schrodinger:

  $ i planck.reduce frac(diff, diff t) Psi lr((x comma t)) eq lr([minus frac(planck.reduce^2, 2 m) frac(diff^2, diff x^2) plus V lr((x comma t))]) Psi lr((x comma t)) $ <schrodinger>

  #blockquote[
    But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. Increase ease-of-use to where `variable` and `print()` shall be of use.

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? @stokes has a nice example.

  Let $Sigma$ be a smooth oriented surface in $RR^3$ with boundary $diff Sigma
  equiv Gamma$. If a vector field $iboxed(bold(F)(x,y,z))=(F_x (x,y,z), F_y (x,y,z),

  in a region containing $Sigma$, then
